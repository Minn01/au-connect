// Seed LOCAL TEST data for AU Connect.
//
// Purpose: populate a local test database so the app looks like a real social
// network while scrolling (feed, connect, jobs, community, messaging).
//
// Constraints by design:
//   • writes ONLY to MongoDB - no Azure blob writes, all media fields null
//     (the UI renders initials avatars / DEFAULT_PROFILE_PIC fallbacks)
//   • all fake emails use @seed.aunetwork.test so the seed is identifiable
//   • re-runnable: deletes only its own previous data before re-creating
//   • refuses to run against anything that is not localhost (safety guard)
//
// Usage (Mongo must be reachable from this host, e.g. via the seed overlay):
//   DATABASE_URL="mongodb://localhost:27018/au-connect?directConnection=true" \
//     pnpm db:seed
