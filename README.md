## Recommendation service configuration

Profile changes that affect recommendations ask the recommendation service to
refresh the user's embedding. Configure these server-side variables for the AU
Connect process:

```env
RECOMMENDATION_SERVICE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
RECOMMENDATION_SERVICE_API_KEY=replace-with-shared-secret
```

`RECOMMENDATION_SERVICE_API_KEY` contains the shared internal-service secret
and must have the same value as the recommendation service's `INTERNAL_API_KEY`.
Do not prefix either variable with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. When AU Connect runs in
Docker and the recommendation service runs on the host, use
`http://host.docker.internal:8000`, as shown in `compose.example.yml`.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

Video posts allow 1 video per post, maximum 512 MB (512,000,000 bytes).
Accepted formats are MP4, MOV, and WebM, with no duration limit.
The frontend checks `File.size` immediately; the backend verifies Azure Blob
`contentLength`, the file signature, ownership, and attachment rules. Validation
reads only the first 4 KB of video bytes and requires no media-processing tools.
