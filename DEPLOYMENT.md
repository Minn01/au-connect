# Deploying AU Connect on life.au.edu

This is how to deploy the AU Connect system on the life.au.edu server. It runs
three app images (pulled from Docker Hub) + MongoDB as containers with Docker
Compose, all on one private network:

- `au-connect-app` — the main Next.js app · `127.0.0.1:3000` → `life.au.edu/connect`
- `au-connect-admin` — the admin app · `127.0.0.1:3001` → `life.au.edu/connect-admin`
- `au-connect-reco` — the recommendation API (FastAPI) · **internal only**, no host port
- `au-connect-mongo` — MongoDB (single-node replica set) · **internal only**

Only the two app ports are exposed (through nginx). The recommendation API and
MongoDB are reachable only inside the private network. The reverse proxy (nginx)
and redeployment are handled by the AU team's own setup, so this repo doesn't
run its own.

One thing to keep in mind: the Mongo data lives in a Docker volume
(`ac-mongo-data`) on the server, and nothing backs it up for you. Set up a
regular `mongodump` so you don't lose the data if the server goes down.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose on the server
- `make`
- Access to the server and permission to edit its nginx config

## Steps

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tommyzizii/au-connect.git
cd au-connect
```

### 2. Create the three env files

Each app gets its own env file (all gitignored — never commit real secrets):

```bash
cp .env.template .env                                # main app
cp .env.admin.example .env.admin                     # admin app
cp .env.recommendation.example .env.recommendation   # recommendation api
```

### 3. Fill in the values

Open each file and fill it in. The `.env.admin` and `.env.recommendation`
variables come from those repos' own READMEs. For the main app's `.env`, the
key ones:

```dotenv
APP_PUBLIC_URL=https://life.au.edu/connect         # runtime public URL
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=                                        # openssl rand -base64 32
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://mongo:27017/au-connect?directConnection=true

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET=

AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY=
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=
AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME=

GMAIL_USER=
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=
```

For the OAuth logins to work, register these redirect URIs with each provider
(Google Cloud Console, LinkedIn, and Microsoft Entra ID), using your real
`APP_PUBLIC_URL` as the base URL:

```
<APP_PUBLIC_URL>/api/connect/v1/auth/google/callback
<APP_PUBLIC_URL>/api/connect/v1/auth/linkedin/callback
<APP_PUBLIC_URL>/api/connect/v1/auth/azure-ad/callback
```

The AU team decides the final URL, so let us know what it is and we'll add the
redirect URIs. Until that's done, Google/LinkedIn/Microsoft login won't work.

### 4. Start it

```bash
make prod-up
```

This pulls the three images from Docker Hub and starts them plus MongoDB. The
main app listens on `127.0.0.1:3000` and the admin app on `127.0.0.1:3001` —
neither is exposed to the internet directly; the AU team's nginx sits in front.
The recommendation API and MongoDB have no host port at all.

### 5. Set up nginx

The AU team adds routes to their existing nginx. The main app example is in
[`deploy/nginx/au-connect.conf.example`](deploy/nginx/au-connect.conf.example):

```
life.au.edu/               ->  127.0.0.1:3000   (Next redirects to /connect)
life.au.edu/connect        ->  127.0.0.1:3000   (main app)
life.au.edu/connect-admin  ->  127.0.0.1:3001   (admin app)
```

Forward the exact `/`, `/connect`, and `/connect/...` paths without changing the
URI. Next redirects `/` to `/connect` on localhost and the production host.
The admin app uses its own `/connect-admin` route. Then reload nginx:

```bash
sudo nginx -t && sudo nginx -s reload
```

### 6. Stopping it

```bash
make prod-down
```

The `ac-mongo-data` volume sticks around, so your data is safe across restarts.

## How updates get deployed

Each of the three repos builds and pushes its **own** image; the server just
pulls them. The AU team handles the redeploy on their side. The flow is:

```
merge to main in a repo  ->  its GitHub Actions builds & pushes its image
   (au-connect, admin, recommendation → 3 images on Docker Hub)
                                  |
               the AU team pulls the new image and restarts the container
```

To redeploy by hand on the server: `make prod-pull` then `make prod-up`.

Each of the three repos owns its own `Dockerfile` + push workflow
(`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`). This repo (au-connect) also holds the shared
`docker-compose.prod.yml` that runs all three images together.

### One-time CI setup

Add the two secrets used to publish the image: `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and
`DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`. The public hostname is runtime configuration and is not
compiled into the Docker image.

## About the /connect path

The main app is served under `/connect` everywhere: `basePath: "/connect"` is
set in `next.config.ts` for both localhost and production. Next prefixes page
navigation; browser API calls use the `/connect/api/connect/v1` paths in
`lib/constants.ts`. Browser share links use the current browser origin.

Run each deployment with `APP_PUBLIC_URL` set to its externally visible URL,
including `/connect`. OAuth request handlers can derive the current host from
forwarded request headers, while notification email links require the runtime
value. The server rejects a missing or invalid URL for production background
work instead of sending localhost links.
